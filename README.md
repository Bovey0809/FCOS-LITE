# FCOS-LITE
Just a moment, please.

Since the network in my Lab has been down, I can't train this model on the server.
I don't know whether the project works.

So,

Just wait for me, patiently.

A warm-hearted guy told me there was something wrong in my code. I really wanna check it and fix it, but I can't.

So,

Just wait for me, patiently.

Thanks, everyone!
